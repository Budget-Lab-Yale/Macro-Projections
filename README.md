# Macro-Projections
Projections of macroeconomic and budgetary aggregates. Based on CBO's baseline. Used as input for Budget Lab models, both for the baseline economic outlook and for analysis of alternative economic scenarios. 

In the interest of time, the current iteration of this component is a spreadsheet which takes as input raw data (stored in shared/raw_data) from CBO and other sources. The spreadsheet contains simple functions which compile and, where necessary, transform macro series -- both historical data and CBO projections. V2 of Macro-Projections will be a replicable codebase which performs these same operations.
